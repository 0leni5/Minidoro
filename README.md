# Minidoro
Minidoro is a passion project all about creating a minimalistic, free of distractions pomodoro timer. It is light-weight and simple. Customizable just enough to ease workflow but not distract from it: your own session duration, only a handful of sounds to choose from and simple colour palette customizations. Minidoro has also clock just under the timer, so you always stay on track with time spent.
