# Goals
The following contains a list of goals I want to achieve with this project. It is there to help me stay on track, not add unnecessary features and know what to do at all times.

## Features
- Minimalistic design
- Transparent timer
- Lock/move modes
- Shortcuts for starting/stopping timer
- Several sounds

### Further description of the features
#### Minimalistic design
I want to keep the design as distraction-free as possible. That means only timer that is displayed and nothing else. Additionally, as little buttons as possible.
#### Transparent timer
Pretty self-explanatory. Timer must be transparent and not obstruct view in any way, so the user still has whole screen available for their work while still seeing (just barely) timer ticking.
#### Lock/move modes
User can move timer around but once it goes to locked position, it is not affected by any clicks on it and lets those clicks affect the app beneath the timer instead. Lock mode makes timer ghost, barely visible and unmodifiable.
#### Shortcuts
Again, self-explanatory. User can use simple to remember and use shortcuts to not switch between lock/move modes constantly.
#### Several sounds
User may choose different types of sounds for the timer. However, these options cannot be in a large number as to not overwhelm or distract the user.
